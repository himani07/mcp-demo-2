# MCP Demo Repository

A demo repository for **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** - showcasing how AI models can interact with external tools and services.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI models to securely access external tools, data sources, and services. It provides a standardized way for AI assistants to:

- Connect to databases and APIs
- Access file systems and repositories  
- Interact with development tools
- Integrate with various services and platforms

## Features of This Demo

This repository demonstrates various MCP capabilities including:

- üõ† **Tool Integration** - Examples of connecting AI models to external tools
- üìä **Data Access** - Showcasing secure data source connections
- üïµÔ∏è **Real-time Interactions** - Dynamic tool usage and responses
- üîí **Security** - Best practices for secure AI-tool interactions
